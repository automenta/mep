## Target Research Areas

### 1. Neuromorphic Hardware (Highest Priority)

**Why EP Matters:**
- Local learning rules match analog substrate constraints
- No weight transport problem (critical for neuromorphic chips)
- Event-based dynamics suit asynchronous hardware
- Energy efficiency potential

**Target Partners:**

Subject: Collaboration Opportunity: Equilibrium Propagation for Neuromorphic Hardware

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding potential collaboration on biologically plausible 
learning for neuromorphic hardware.

We've developed MEP (Muon Equilibrium Propagation), an open-source framework 
that achieves performance parity with backpropagation (~95% MNIST) while using 
only local learning rules—making it ideal for neuromorphic implementation.

Key advantages for neuromorphic hardware:
- No weight transport problem (biologically plausible)
- Local Hebbian-like updates
- Event-based settling dynamics
- Compatible with analog/mixed-signal substrates

We're looking for hardware partners to:
1. Benchmark EP on Loihi/SpiNNaker
2. Quantify energy efficiency vs backprop
3. Publish joint results

Our codebase: [GitHub link]
Performance baselines: [Link to PERFORMANCE_BASELINES.md]

Would you be interested in a brief call to discuss collaboration opportunities?

Best regards,
[Name]
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] EP benchmark on neuromorphic hardware
- [ ] Energy efficiency comparison paper
- [ ] Joint publication at Neuromorphic Computing venue

**Timeline:** 3-6 months

### 2. Computational Neuroscience

**Why EP Matters:**
- EP's learning dynamics may better match biological neural circuits
- No symmetric weights required (unlike backprop)
- Energy-based formulation matches neural energy minimization theories

Subject: Collaboration: EP as Model for Biological Learning

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding potential collaboration on using Equilibrium 
Propagation as a model for biological learning.

EP offers several advantages over backprop for neuroscience:
- No weight transport problem (matches biological constraints)
- Local learning rules (Hebbian-like)
- Energy-based formulation
- Achieves ~95% MNIST accuracy (performance parity proven)

We're looking for neuroscience partners to:
1. Compare EP learning dynamics to neural recording data
2. Develop metrics for "biological plausibility"
3. Publish comparison of EP vs backprop vs biological learning

Our validated implementation: [GitHub link]

Would this align with your research interests?

Best regards,
[Name]
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] EP vs neural data comparison
- [ ] Biological plausibility metrics
- [ ] Joint publication at computational neuroscience venue

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

### 3. Continual Learning Research

**Why EP Matters:**
- Error feedback reduces forgetting (32% vs 48% in our tests)
- Energy-based formulation may offer advantages
- EWC integration opportunity

**Current Status:**
- EP+EF reduces forgetting but slows initial learning
- EWC is more effective (5-15% forgetting) but not yet integrated with EP
- Opportunity: EP+EWC may outperform backprop+EWC

**Target Partners:**

| Organization | Lab | Focus | Status |
|--------------|-----|-------|--------|
| [TBD] | [TBD] | Continual learning | 📧 Outreach needed |
| [TBD] | [TBD] | Catastrophic forgetting | 📧 Outreach needed |

**Research Plan:**
1. Implement EWC integration for EP
2. Test on standard CL benchmarks (Permuted MNIST, Split CIFAR)
3. Compare EP+EWC vs backprop+EWC

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] EP+EWC implementation
- [ ] CL benchmark results
- [ ] Joint publication at CL venue

**Timeline:** 3-6 months

### 4. Energy Efficiency Analysis

**Why EP Matters:**
- Despite higher memory, EP may be more energy-efficient
- Analog implementations could be dramatically more efficient
- Important for edge deployment

**Target Partners:**

| Organization | Lab | Focus | Status |
|--------------|-----|-------|--------|
| [TBD] | [TBD] | Green AI | 📧 Outreach needed |
| [TBD] | [TBD] | ML energy profiling | 📧 Outreach needed |

**Research Plan:**
1. Profile energy consumption (Joules/sample) for EP vs backprop
2. Analyze memory movement costs
3. Model energy efficiency for analog implementations

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Energy profiling study
- [ ] Efficiency comparison paper
- [ ] Joint publication at ML systems venue

**Timeline:** 3-6 months
