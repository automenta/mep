## Vision

**Equilibrium Propagation (EP)** offers a fundamentally different approach to neural network training: instead of backpropagating errors through a computation graph, networks settle to energy minima, and gradients emerge from the contrast between equilibrium states.

**MEP** enhances EP with geometry-aware optimization—combining EP's biological plausibility with modern techniques for stable, efficient training. Our goal: make biologically plausible learning practical for real-world applications while opening new research directions in neuromorphic computing, continual learning, and energy-efficient AI.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from mep import smep, muon_backprop

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(256, 10)
)

# Option 1: EP mode (biologically plausible)
optimizer = smep(model.parameters(), model=model, mode='ep')
optimizer.step(x=x, target=y)  # No .backward() needed!

# Option 2: Backprop mode (drop-in replacement)
optimizer = muon_backprop(model.parameters())
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

### Optimal EP Configuration

```python
from mep import smep

optimizer = smep(
    model.parameters(),
    model=model,
    lr=0.01,
    mode='ep',
    beta=0.5,           # Nudging strength
    settle_steps=30,    # Settling iterations
    settle_lr=0.15,     # Settling learning rate
    loss_type='mse',    # Stable energy
    use_error_feedback=False,
)
```

## How MEP Works

### Equilibrium Propagation Foundation

EP trains networks through an energy-based formulation:

1. **Free Phase (β=0):** Input is presented, network settles to equilibrium by minimizing internal energy
2. **Nudged Phase (β>0):** Target gently nudges the output, network settles to a new equilibrium
3. **Gradient from Contrast:** The difference between free and nudged states approximates the gradient

```
Free Phase:                    Nudged Phase:
Input → [Layers] → Output      Input → [Layers] → Output ← Target (nudge)
        ↓ settles                       ↓ settles
      states*                         states^β
        
Gradient = (states^β - states*) / β
```

**Key advantage:** No backward pass through the computation graph. Learning uses only local information at each layer.

### The MEP Enhancement: S-D-M

MEP adds three key innovations to stabilize and accelerate EP:

#### **S — Spectral Constraints**

EP requires contractive dynamics for stable settling. We enforce this through spectral normalization:

```python
σ(W) ≤ γ < 1  # Spectral radius bounded
```

This guarantees convergence to a unique fixed point, eliminating the oscillatory behavior that plagued early EP implementations.

**Implementation:** Power iteration after each update, enforcing σ(W) ≤ 0.95 by default.

#### **D — Dion Low-Rank Updates**

For large weight matrices (>100K parameters), we use low-rank SVD approximation:

```python
G ≈ U @ S @ V^T
update = U @ V^T  # Scale-invariant orthogonal update
```

This reduces computational cost while preserving gradient information in the dominant subspace. Error feedback accumulates residuals to recover lost information over time.

**Benefit:** Enables EP to scale to larger models without prohibitive compute costs.

#### **M — Muon Orthogonalization**

We apply Newton-Schulz iteration to orthogonalize gradients before applying updates:

```python
X_{k+1} = ½ X_k (3I - X_k^T X_k)
```

This improves conditioning and enables stable training at greater depths, similar to how batch normalization helps backprop but without the additional parameters.

**Benefit:** Better gradient flow, faster convergence, more stable training.

## Why MEP Matters

### Biological Plausibility

Backpropagation has a fundamental problem: it requires symmetric forward and backward weights (the "weight transport problem"). This is biologically implausible—real brains don't have access to exact transpose weights.

**EP solves this:** Learning uses only local information. Each layer updates based on its own activity contrast, not global error signals.

**Potential impact:** Better models of biological learning, insights into how real brains learn.

### Neuromorphic Computing

Digital backpropagation is energy-inefficient on emerging analog hardware. EP's local learning rules and event-based dynamics map naturally to:

- **Optical chips** — continuous-time dynamics
- **Memristor arrays** — local weight updates
- **SpiNNaker/Loihi** — asynchronous event-based processing

**Potential impact:** Energy-efficient AI on specialized hardware.

### Continual Learning

EP's energy-based formulation and error feedback mechanisms may offer advantages for learning sequential tasks without catastrophic forgetting.

**Potential impact:** Agents that learn continuously like humans do.

### Research Tool

MEP provides a well-tested, performant implementation for researchers studying:
- Alternative learning mechanisms
- Energy-based models
- Local learning rules
- Non-backprop architectures
