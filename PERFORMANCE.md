# MEP Performance Benchmarks

This document will store the results of comprehensive benchmarks comparing SDMEP against baseline optimizers (SGD, Adam, Muon).

## Methodology

Benchmarks are run using `mep.benchmarks.runner` with the following configurations:
-   **Tasks:** MNIST (fMNIST/CIFAR-10 planned)
-   **Architectures:** MLP (3-layer), ConvNet (planned)
-   **Metrics:** Training Loss, Test Accuracy, Spectral Norm Stability.

## Results

*(To be populated by future benchmark runs. See `README.md` for instructions on running benchmarks.)*
